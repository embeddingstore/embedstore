## Quick start
### Installation
You have two ways to get started:
1. Install our python library : `pip install embedstore`
2. Directly call the endpoint : `https://api.embedding.store/retrieve`


### Get API Key [here](https://api.embedding.store/register)
**Note:** Currently we are rate-limiting all API keys to 100 requests/day

Set the `EMBEDSTORE_API_KEY` as environment variable
```python
import os
os.environ["EMBEDSTORE_API_KEY"] = <YOUR API KEY> 
```
Pass the API key as header if you are calling the endpoint directly. More details about the [endpoint](#using-retrieve-endpoint)
```python
headers = {'API-Key': <YOUR_API_KEY>}
```

### Retrieve context
In a few lines of code, you can now start retrieving relevant context to get better answers from your LLM. We have already embedded Podcast Transcripts and Arxiv Research Papers, with new dataset drops every week ([full list here](#datasets))
```python
from embedstore.rag.retrievers import EmbedStoreRetriever

# Initialize the retriever
arxiv_retriever = EmbedStoreRetriever(dataset_id = "arxiv_01", num_docs=3)

# Query the retriever
context = arxiv_retriever.query("What is the state of the art in Autonomous Driving security and safety?")

# Examine the retrieved context and then append it to the prompt before you call your LLM
print(context[0])
```

Read more [here](#usage) for detailed usage guidelines. 

## What is this?
We are building context retrieval apis for developers creating chatbots, copilots and search tools on top of LLMs. You no longer need to maintain scraping and embedding pipelines, and instead focus on building your product. 

Read more about RAG (retrieval augmented generation) [here](https://twitter.com/pwang_szn/status/1663123050097946624).

## Usage
### More about `EmbedStoreRetriever` class
`EmbedStoreRetriever` serves as the single point of entrance to interact with the embedstore.

Parameters to initialize the class :
- `dataset_id (str)` : Dataset to query and retrieve context from (eg: `arxiv_01`, `podcasts_01`)
- `num_docs (int)` : Number of context to retrieve from the embeddings


### Advanced filtering while querying
You can use `EmbedStoreRetriever.query()` to get context based on the user prompt and also perform filtering.

The `query()` function takes two inputs:
- `prompt (str)`: The user prompt that you are querying for 
- `post_processing_config (dict)`: A dictionary of dataset specific filters ([check here](#datasets) for available options)

#### Example : Temporal filter on Arxiv research papers

```python
from embedstore.rag.retrievers import EmbedStoreRetriever

# Initialize the retriever
arxiv_retriever = EmbedStoreRetriever(dataset_id = "arxiv_01", num_docs=3)

# Query the retriever
user_query = "What are some recent papers about CRISPR? Give me a brief summary of major trends."

# Filter to do semantic search on papers published in the last 6 months
post_processing_config = {"filters":{"publish_date_start":"2022-12-01T0:0:0Z"}}

# Calling the `query()` function
context = arxiv_retriever.query(user_query,post_processing_config)
```

#### Example : Categorical filter on Podcast Transcripts

```python
# Initialize the retriever
podcast_retriever = EmbedStoreRetriever(dataset_id = "podcasts_01", num_docs=3)

# Query the retriever
user_query = "What are people saying about the new Twitter CEO?"

# Filter to search on Business and Technology podcast episodes
post_processing_config = {"filters":{"category":["Business","Technology"]}}

# Calling the `query()` function
context = podcast_retriever.query(user_query,post_processing_config)
```
### Download raw embeddings
You can download raw vector embeddings along with the metadata. 

**Note**: we are limiting the downloads to 5000 vectors. If you want the full set of embeddings, reach out to us at hello@embedding.store.
```python
from embedstore.rag.datadownloaders import download_embeddings

path_to_folder = "" #local path where you want to download the embeddings
download_embeddings('podcasts_01', path_to_folder)
```
`download_embeddings()` downloads the embeddings in `.pkl` format. You can load the file using the following code. The embeddings are stored in a list of tuples `(vector[], metadata{})`

```python
with open(path_to_pickle_file, 'rb') as f:
    import pickle
    data = pickle.load(f)
```

### Using `/retrieve` endpoint 
**Sample code**
  ```python
  import requests
  url = 'https://api.embedding.store/retrieve'
  headers = {'API-Key': <YOUR_API_KEY>}

  # creating the payload
  payload = {"query": <PROMPT>,"dataset_params": {"dataset_id":"podcasts_01", "filters":{"category":["Business"]}}}

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers,payload=payload)

  # check the response
  print(response.json())
  ```

**Authorization**
Add the API key in the header : `{'API-Key'='<YOUR_API_KEY>'`

**Parameters**
| Param             | Details | Type  | Example
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| query | the prompt on which context need to be retrieved  | `str`  | `What does Tim Ferris say about productivity?` |
| dataset_params | a dictionary of dataset specific parameters like dataset_id and filters. [check here](#datasets) for available filters  |  `dict` | `{"dataset_id":"podcasts_01", "filters":{"category":["Business"]}` |

By default, the API returns the top 3 contexts right now. We will be adding options to control this soon.

So you say jump on the 6a because it's cheaper? I would actually jump on the 7, even though it's a little bit more expensive. Yeah, because the tech is a little bit better. So that's just my personal opinion. I would love to see the tablet come out. Hopefully that does get announced, even though they haven't officially said anything. It's about time. I would be shocked if they don't announce it. It is about time, yes. I'm really curious if it's going to be another cheap Android tablet or if we've seen a few rumors about prices, but not a lot about the specs. So if it's a tablet that I could actually get some work done on, then I would seriously consider it because that would integrate very, very well into an Android content creator"}
